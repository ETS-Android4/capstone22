# Carolina com.example.carolina_coffee.Coffee

The Carlina com.example.carolina_coffee.Coffee Application is a user friendly application that will allow users to conveniently
select a drink, and modify the drink to the users preference. The application will allow the
user to place the order in real time, sending the order to the store, and notifying the user of the
drinks order upon completion.

Your audience for the Readme.md are other developers who are joining your team.
Specifically, the file should contain detailed instructions that any developer
can follow to install, compile, run, and test your project. These are not only
useful to new developers, but also to you when you have to re-install everything
because your old laptop crashed. Also, the teachers of this class will be
following your instructions.

## External Requirements

Android Studio 

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/)


If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

You only need to add instructions for the OS you are using.

## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.


## Running 

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo. 

To run the application from Android Studio, the user must select an available 
device to emulate the Android app on. Once they have one selected, the user can
go to Build > Make Project. After that, there should be no issues running the application.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
.Note that you **do not put passwords in git**.

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

The unit tests are in `/App/build/src/test/java/CartTest`.

The behavioral tests are in `/App/build/src/androidTest/java/RegisterPageActivity/`.

Please use emulators that are up-to-date (2020-2022).

## Testing Technology  

Android Studio comes with a built in selection of library testing dependencies and functions,
for this application the dependencies are already added to the build gradle for testing and functionality
purposes. 

## Running Tests

One the user has located the appropriate test folder and its corresponding classes,
[right click]+[Run] on the drop down menu. This process will automatically run the test 
for the user.

Please use emulators that are up-to-date (2020-2022).
The code and API's require this, all other are unacceptable.
