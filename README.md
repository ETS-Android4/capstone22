# Carolina Coffee

The Carlina Coffee Application is a user friendly application that will allow users to conveniently
select a drink, and modify the drink to the users preference. The application will allow the
user to place the order in real time, sending the order to the store, and notifying the user of the
drinks order upon completion.

## External Requirements

Android Studio 

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/)

## Running

To run the application from Android Studio, the user must select an available 
device to emulate the Android app on. Once they have one selected, the user can
go to Build > Make Project. After that, there should be no issues running the application.
 
## Deployment
 
Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
.Note that you **do not put passwords in git**.

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

## Testing 
  
The unit tests are in `/App/src/test/java/com/example/carolina_coffee`.

The behavioral tests are in `/App/build/src/androidTest/java/RegisterPageActivity/`.

Please use emulators that are up-to-date (2020-2022).

## Testing Technology  
 
Android Studio comes with a built in selection of library testing dependencies and functions,
for this application the dependencies are already added to the build gradle for testing and functionality
purposes. 

## Running Tests

One the user has located the appropriate test folder and its corresponding classes,
[right click]+[Run] on the drop down menu. This process will automatically run the test 
for the user.

Please use emulators that are up-to-date (2020-2022).
Recommended using a live device for best performance. 
The code and API's require this, all other are unacceptable.
